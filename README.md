# ft-tech
A simple package that returns a promise for each url

## To execute
1. Install the packages required to run the code using:
`npm install`

2. Execute the code:
`node index.js`

3. Run the tests:
`node run test`

### Time taken & thoughts
- 30 mins on setting up node - didn't know there was a difference between frontend js & nodejs, namely using fetchAPI as I wanted to keep it as lightweight as possible.
- Also note that this is my first time building a js package & working with Promises via nodeJs... it was an interesting experience to say the least.
- This involved me firstly trying to set up & configure babel & webpack.
- Then I realised that this would be overkill for a small package solely because I wanted to use es7.
- Thought it was best to not use `node --experimental features index.mjs` since I want the user to a stable node command but also be able to work in any project that utilizes the package.
- spent 40 mins on designing my functions, overall design & what packages I would need plus research.
- spent 45 mins on writing the code and tackling promises
- spent 20 mins on tests.
- for the minutes spent on this project, I time myself using a pomodoro type clock, I naturally do this.

- Note: If this was actual development I would be branching out into feature branches & rebasing into dev once a feature is complete.
